# Ecosystem Grant Snapshot Vote - Tranche 2

This is a weighted snapshot vote for the second 4.5M GLMR tranche of the Moonbeam Ecosystem Grant Program. The full details of the Use of the Snapshot Vote can be found in the Revised Grant Program, but here is a summary of the rules:

-   Teams need to receive the equivalent of 250K USD/1,032,204 GLMR (250K at a 0.2422$ 7-day TWAP) of the vote to be eligible. This represents 22.93% of vote
-   Any team receiving less than this amount will not be eligible and the funds will go to the grant committee instead.
-   In the case where more than 1.75M GLMR is left-over, the vote is considered “hung” and invalid.
-   Teams cannot receive more than 2,000,000 GLMR, which represents 44.44% of the vote.
-   Any amounts over 2M GLMR will be redistributed across the remaining teams that are eligible; i.e. those that received 22.93% (or more) of the vote.

GLMR holders can vote with both free and reserved (i.e. staked) GLMR. The amount of GLMR that you can use for voting is what you had in your wallet at the time this snapshot vote was created.
