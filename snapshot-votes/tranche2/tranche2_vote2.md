# Ecosystem Grant Tranche 2 - Second Signal Snapshot vote

This is a weighted snapshot ([https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types#weighted-voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types#weighted-voting)) vote for the remaining 3.5M GLMR tranche of the Moonbeam Ecosystem Grant Program ([https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/t/ecosystem-grants-how-to-submit-your-draft-proposal-and-participate-in-community-voting/510](https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/t/ecosystem-grants-how-to-submit-your-draft-proposal-and-participate-in-community-voting/510)). The full rules for the use of this signal vote can be found in the Update on the Tranche 2 Ecosystem Vote post ([https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/t/update-on-the-tranche-2-ecosystem-vote/1126](https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/t/update-on-the-tranche-2-ecosystem-vote/1126)), but here is a summary of the rules:

-   This is a signal vote to gauge community sentiment and the results will need to be ratified in an on-chain referendum.
-   Only the top THREE (3) teams at the end of this snapshot vote will be eligible to go on to the on-chain referendum, provided they meet a minimum awarded GLMR threshold requirement.
-   Each team must secure a minimum of 500,000 awarded GLMR (not voting power), which means they need to secure at least 14.28% of the total votes.
-   If this threshold is not met, the % of the 3.5M will go to the Community Grants Bucket.
-   Otherwise, teams will win a % of the 3.5M GLMR equal to their vote when the second snapshot vote closes.
-   The most a team can win in the second snapshot vote is what they asked for in their original grant proposal - in other words, they are capped at their ask.
-   No other adjustments will be made to their final amount.
-   Amounts that would have gone to the remaining 6 teams are sent to the Community Grants Bucket instead.
-   After the second snapshot vote completes, separate on-chain Moonbeam referenda will be created, at the same time:
-   1 referendum will be for TFA DAO.
-   The other 3 referenda will be for the three winners of the 2nd signal vote, assuming that they met the threshold requirement.
-   The community will need to ratify each one of those referenda.
-   If any referendum is defeated, the amount instead goes to the Community Grants Bucket.
-   Any team can then apply for a grant from the committee (teams that filed proposals or other teams), but the normal grant committee rules apply - i.e. the committee will research the project, perform diligence and vote; and grant requests are capped at 250K USD.
-   Throughout the entire voting process (snapshot AND on-chain referendum) teams are encouraged to rally their communities to vote on their behalf, but they cannot offer any sort of financial reward to their communities to vote - this includes GLMR, their own native token, stable coins or fiat. NFTs are allowed; as long as these are along the lines of “I voted for team x” (i.e. no “Bored Apes” NFTs worth thousands of dollars, for obvious reasons).

GLMR holders can vote with both free and reserved (i.e. staked) GLMR. The amount of GLMR that you can use for voting is what you had in your wallet at the time this snapshot vote was created.
