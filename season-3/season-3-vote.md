# Season 3 Grant Ecosystem Vote
This is an on-chain vote to allocate the third season of our ecosystem grants, totaling 4.5 million GLMR, strategically guided by the recommendations provided by Gauntlet. This initiative represents a significant step forward in the growth of the Moonbeam ecosystem.

## Vote Details:

-   Budget: 4.5 million GLMR
    
-   Start Time: Thursday, May 30th at 14:00 UTC
    
-   End Time: ~Thursday, June 6th
    
-   Track: Fast General Admin
    
-   Voting Platform: Moonbeam On-Chain Governance vote
    

Voting will be a single vote to approve the entire budget allocation and will be a simple Aye/Nay vote on Moonbeam. The vote will use the new Fast General Admin track and the OpenGov support curves. In principle this makes it a 7 day vote, although it could complete earlier if there is a lot of support. Please note that there is no Snapshot vote this time around.

## Grant Distribution:

The distribution of the third season grant budget is based on the  [recommendations](gauntlet-recommendations.md)  provided by Gauntlet. If approved, the grant funds will be distributed as follows:

-   1,350,000 GLMR (30%) to Stellaswap (DEX)
    
-   1,125,000 GLMR (25%) to Moonwell (Lending Protocol)
    
-   1,125,000 GLMR (25%) to Prime Protocol (Cross-Chain Interactions)
    
-   900,000 GLMR (20%) to Beamswap (Innovative Products)
    

## Recipient Responsibilities:

### Incentive Readiness

All teams receiving grants have communicated their readiness to deploy incentives by June 14th, in alignment with Gauntlet’s strategic recommendations to maximize grant impact.

### Grant Evaluation Framework:

Following the guidelines of Gauntlet’s  [ecosystem grant evaluation framework ](gauntlet-framework.md), each team has shared metrics for their protocol for the 2 month “before” period of the grant cycle and are pending review. These are the mean values between March 29th, and May 28th, 2024 for:

-   **TVL**: the total USD value locked within the protocol, indicating the amount of capital deposited by users
    
-   **DAU**: the number of unique users who interact with the protocol within a 24-hour period.
    
-   **trading volume**: the cumulative value of all trades executed on the platform, converted to USD
    
-   **trading fees**: The total fees collected by the protocol as a percentage of the trading volume
    
-   **capital efficiency**: The ratio of trading volume to TVL, indicating how effectively the protocol uses its locked capital to generate activity.
    

Going forward, teams should develop a publicly available rest endpoint so this data can be easily collected.

Upon completion of the grant, the foundation will collect these same metrics from teams for the 60 day period after completion of the grant, i.e. the period between December 14th 2024, and February 15th, 2025. This will let the foundation assess the impact of the grants and share a comprehensive report with the community.
