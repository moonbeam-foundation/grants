# Gauntlet Recommendations for Moonbeam Ecosystem Grant Allocation

For future Moonbeam grant allocations, Gauntlet recommends:

-   30% of funds to Stellaswap (DEX)
-   25% to Moonwell (lending protocols)
-   25% to Prime Protocol (applications promoting cross-chain interactions)
-   20% to Beamswap (innovative products)

# Recommendations

## General Recommendations for Future Grants

Gauntlet recommends the following allocations for future grant programs with corresponding rationale:

1.  **30% of funds to existing DEXes:**  Strengthening the foundation: DEXes are the backbone of any DeFi ecosystem, providing the essential infrastructure for token swaps, liquidity provision, and price discovery. Allocating a significant portion of the funds (30%) to existing DEXes underlines the importance of a robust and efficient decentralized exchange infrastructure for the overall health and attractiveness of the Moonbeam ecosystem.
2.  **25% of funds to lending protocols:**  Prioritizing Market Demands: With lending protocols comprising nearly ~75% of TVL on Moonbeam, lending is clearly a pivotal activity within the ecosystem. Allocating 25% of the funds to lending protocols acknowledges their significant role and popularity, ensuring continued support and incentivization for these essential services.
3.  **25% to applications promoting cross-chain interactions:**  Interoperability as a growth driver: In the Moonbeam ecosystem, interoperability is not just a feature but a necessity for growth. Allocating 25% of the funds to cross-chain applications acknowledges the critical role these applications play in enhancing the accessibility of assets across different DeFi ecosystems. This strategic investment supports projects that connect Moonbeam with other chains, thereby increasing the utility and reach of the Moonbeam ecosystem and attracting a wider user base.
4.  **20% to innovative products:**  Fostering innovation and diversity: The allocation of 20% of the funds to innovative products is designed to spark creativity and experimentation within the Moonbeam ecosystem. This segment targets new projects that bring fresh ideas and approaches, such as advanced AMM models that offer improved price execution and more attractive LP rewards, perpetuals protocols, novel technologies that enhance cross-chain capabilities, real-world asset (RWA) integration, gaming platforms, novel social protocols, and other innovative DeFi solutions.

## Strategies for Allocating Funds Across DEXes: Trade-offs Between Allocating to One DEX vs. Multiple DEXes

When deciding whether to allocate funds to one DEX or multiple DEXes, there are several trade-offs to consider:

### Allocating to a Single DEX

**TL;DR:**

-   Increased Liquidity Depth and Reduced Fragmentation
-   Simplified User Experience
-   Simplified Security Measures

**Pros:**

Rewarding the market leader can help establish a strong, central liquidity hub for the ecosystem. By concentrating liquidity, the DEX can offer better trading experiences with higher depth, tighter spreads, and increased trading volume. This, in turn, can attract more users and liquidity providers, creating a positive feedback loop for the ecosystem. Furthermore, with only one application to perform swaps, users benefit from a simpler trading experience, potentially encouraging new user adoption. Lastly, single DEX ecosystems have a reduced range of security issues with only one application to audit, monitor, and continuously keep safe.

**Cons:**

However, allocating funds to a single DEX also comes with centralization risks. The ecosystem could suffer if the DEX experiences technical issues, security breaches, or if the team behind it fails to deliver on its promises. Moreover, a lack of competition may lead to complacency and slower innovation, as the dominant DEX has less incentive to improve its services and adapt to changing market conditions.

### Allocating to Multiple DEXs

**TL;DR:**

-   Reduced Congestion Risk
-   Increased Decentralization and Competition
-   Potential for Specialized Trading Experiences

**Pros:**

Distributing funds across multiple DEXes can help create a more diverse ecosystem and mitigate the risks of relying on a single platform. Multiple DEXes can reduce congestion risk and drive innovation through competition. Additionally, different DEXes may cater to specific market segments or offer specialized trading experiences, leading to a more diverse and inclusive DeFi landscape.

**Cons:**

Allocating funds to multiple DEXes may lead to fragmented liquidity, resulting in less optimal trading experiences with higher slippage and lower volume. It may also dilute the impact of the grant funds by spreading them across multiple platforms, potentially slowing down the growth of individual DEXes.

## Gauntlet’s Recommendation for Upcoming Grant Program

| Funding % | Protocol | Category |
|---|---|---|
|30 | Stellaswap | DEX |
|25 | Moonwell | Lending |
|25 | Prime | Cross-Chain |
|20 | Beamswap | Innovation |

-   **30% of funds to DEXes**
    -   Allocate 100% to Stellaswap
    -   Allocating all DEX funds to Stellaswap aligns with the strategy of concentrating liquidity to establish a strong, central liquidity hub for the ecosystem. As the market leader, Stellaswap can offer better trading experiences with higher depth, tighter spreads, and increased trading volume. This allocation will attract more users and liquidity providers, creating a positive feedback loop for the Moonbeam ecosystem. Additionally, users will benefit from a simpler trading experience with only one application to perform swaps, potentially encouraging new user adoption.
-   **25% of funds to lending protocols**
    -   Allocate to Moonwell, as they remain the market-favorite lending protocol on Moonbeam.
-   **25% to applications promoting cross-chain interactions**
    -   Allocate to Prime Protocol, the leading “natively cross-chain protocol” by TVL, recognizing its potential to enhance the interoperability and reach of the Moonbeam ecosystem.
-   **20% to innovative products**
    -   Allocate to Beamswap for perpetuals development, as it is well-positioned to capitalize on the dynamic and rapidly growing perpetuals market. As Beamswap has shown the potential to become the leading perpetuals protocol in the Moonbeam ecosystem, we believe it is worth continuing to invest in their development. Supporting this area could lead to the development of new financial instruments that can attract more professional traders and institutional participants, potentially increasing the platform’s user base and liquidity. Derivatives in TradFi surpass spot and retail trading by a wide margin, showing promise for the future of perpetual and derivative trading within DeFi.

### **Pros**

-   Rewards market leaders in each category:
    -   Stellaswap in DEXes (highest TVL among DEXes)
    -   Moonwell in lending (highest TVL among lending protocols)
    -   Prime Protocol in cross-chain interactions (highest TVL among natively cross-chain protocols)
    -   Beamswap in innovative products (focusing on the rapidly growing perpetuals market)
-   Provides more support to protocols that have proven to be successful
-   Concentrates liquidity in a single DEX, offering better trading experiences and attracting more users and liquidity providers
-   Supports the development of new financial instruments in the perpetuals market, potentially attracting professional traders and institutional participants

### **Cons**

-   Concentration risk: allocating funds to a limited number of protocols may expose the ecosystem to greater risk if any of these protocols face issues or hacks
-   Potential missed opportunities in supporting emerging projects that could contribute to the ecosystem’s growth and diversity
